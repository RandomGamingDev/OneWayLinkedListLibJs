# OneWayLinkedListLib

A simple one way linked list that stores the head, tail and length of the list

This library was created, not only for education purposes, but to be a fast, effiecient and easy to use one way linked list library, which are perfect for things like ECS.

To use it you can simply include https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/RandomGamingDev/OneWayLinkedListLibJs/list.js
in your HTML file! If you want to you can also just download the file and include it in your HTML file that way.

btw stuff updates so remember to specify a version/commit for your library if you want to use a link and don't want your code to automatically update to the newest version of the library
